# hangouts-for-schools
Due to COVID19, schools in a lot of countries have been closed. Teachers therefore lost contact with their classes overnight. 

Do you work in a company that has a Google G Suite Business account? Then you can help teachers to reestablish some level of communication using Google Hangouts.

In order to use Hangouts a pupil needs to have a Google account. This repository [contains](/de) a manual for parents of how to setup one.

It's recommended to set this up with the consent of the teacher.

## chat group
Set up a group on hangouts.google.com with e.g. the name "Sch√ºlerchat Klasse A. B.". Go to participant list on the top and add the exact google account name of the teacher and of each child belonging to this class. The account will appear as "Unknown" even though it exists, that's fine. Next a "Send Invite" popup appears. Confirm this. On the other end, the teacher/child now has to accept this invitation, by clicking on the three dots symbol on the left and then "Invites".
Now pupils can see the chat messages and they can call the group. To call each other, they also have to invite each other first, same process as above. 
However, there is a drawback, a group video call is limited to 10 people.

## class video call
That's where [Google Hangouts Meet](https://meet.google.com) comes in. With your G Suite Business account, setup a (recurring) meeting and invite all the Google accounts. Choose Hangouts Meet for the venue. The maximum number of participants is 250 here, which is more than enough. Also share the meeting link in the chat group e.g. 15 minutes before the meeting.
There is a catch here. After the children clicked on the meeting link you need to grant access to each. So make sure that you are logged in with your Google Hangouts Meet G Suite business account to confirm those requests.
