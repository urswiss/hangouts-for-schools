# hangouts-for-schools
Due to COVID19, schools in a lot of countries have been closed. Teachers therefore lost contact with their classes overnight. 

Do you work in a company that has a Google G Suite Business account? Then you can help teachers to reestablish some level of communication using Google Hangouts.

In order to use Hangouts a pupil needs to have a Google account. This repository contains a manual for parents of how to setup one.

It's recommended to set this up with the consent of the teacher.
